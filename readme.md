Alrighty. This project was one that I had already made. All the html and css are in the public folder. I did it like this because I didn't want to figure out firebase hosting all over again. It uses the firebase api, and I wrote the wrapper website to add the repo to the footer. Just keep in mind that as a notes app, the content it retrieves the api is content that you, the user, write into the app.
